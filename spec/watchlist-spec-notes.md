# Watchlist Notes
    - The watchlist should not be used as a list of what the user is actively watching. Use a combination of the /sync/watched and /shows/:id/progress methods to get what the user is actively watching.
    
    - When an item is watched, it will be automatically removed from the watchlist. For shows and seasons, watching 1 episode will remove the entire show or season.
